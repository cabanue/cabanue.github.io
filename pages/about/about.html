            <p class="about__bio__info__paragraph">I am a full stack developer from Indianapolis. From a young age, I always had a passion for technology. For as long as I remember I have always been on the computer. I completed a web internship the summer before my senior year of high school. From then on, I had an interest in web development.</p>
            <p class="about__bio__info__paragraph">I then went onto IUPUI where I studied under the full stack developer cirriculum. While at IUPUI, I had a lot of fun in my web development courses and learned a lot in my time there. I hope to pursue a full stack developer position in Indiana. </p>
